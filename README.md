# Black-White Image Decoder

## About

[This](https://sturmente.github.io/black-white-image-decoder/) was made for a school project were we hat do come up with a coding for a black and white image

## How does the coding work

[width in pixels][space][height in pixels][space][all pixels from top-left to bottom-right in a row]

The widht, height and the spaces at the end of both are in ascii

I used `00000000` for space instead of `00100000`

**Example:**

█░░█░█

█░░█░░

████░█

█░░█░█

█░░█░█

`00110110000000000011010100000000100101100100111101100101100101`
